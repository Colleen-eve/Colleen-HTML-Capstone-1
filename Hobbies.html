        <li> Family - They are my everything and it's a joy to raise my three kids with my husband. </li>
        <li> Faith - This is a huge part of my life. </li>
        <li> Healthy Life - I work hard at the gym so I can thrive outside of the gym. </li>
        <li> Friends - From all ages and all places, I'm grateful daily for my village.</li>
        <li> Reading - Ask me what I'm reading. I love a good non-fiction or a historical fiction novel.</li>
        <li> Exploring - Traveling and having new experiences. 
            Road side attractions, national parks, far away places - I am up for a trip with my crew. 
            What an amazing world we live in. </li>
        <li> Food - Either we're eating delicious food at home or searching out new spots to try. 
            You've got to eat every day, so you might as well eat good.</li>
